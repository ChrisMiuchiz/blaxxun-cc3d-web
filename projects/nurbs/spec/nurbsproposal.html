<h2><a NAME="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>
This paper describes new nodes proposed for VRML97, based on Non Uniform
Rational B-Splines (NURBS). In general, use of NURBS in VRML would have
the following immediate benefits:
<ul>
<li>
reduced download size of VRML files because of the 
    compact NURBS description 
    

<li>
smoother, richer shapes 
    

<li>
easier authoring, because most 3D modeling programs 
    are already NURBS-based 
    

<li>
better animation, since changing a few parameters 
    has a great impact on shapes and animations 
    

<li>
automatic scalability of the display (LOD) depending on CPU and graphics
card performance and world complexity.</li>
</ul>
NURBS curves and surfaces have been used in industrial design of car bodies,
ship hulls and airplanes for a long time since their mathematical qualities
are especially suited for modeling fluid shapes. Designing with NURBS is
intuitive and easy to understand. Hence, numerous tools beyond CAD/CAM
offer NURBS support. The success of NURBS throughout CAD/CAM/CAE and CGI
in general is due to the following:
<ul>
<li>
Any desired shape can be described using NURBS 
    without loss of mathematical exactness. While shapes like cylinders or 
    conics can only be approximated by polygons, NURBS give an exact 
    mathematical description. 
    

<li>
Intuitive methods to design and manipulate any 
    desired shape are provided by various tools. 
    

<li>
NURBS algorithms are fast and stable.</li>
</ul>
Therefore adopting NURBS support&nbsp; in a VRML environment seems to be
a self-evident step that would yield a number of benefits:
<ul>
<li>
Creating virtual worlds in VRML is always a trade-off between quality (number
of defined polygons) and bandwidth (download size of a world). Smooth surfaces
are created by exporting huge VRML <i>IndexedFaceSets</i> from modeling programs. 
    Objects defined in the NURBS format overcome these limitations because 
    smoothness is obtained with very little data without loss of quality. 
    

<li>
The VRML authoring process is accelerated since 
    NURBS offer intuitive methods for designing objects, especially natural 
    shapes like human bodies. 
    

<li>
The smoothness and curvature can be easily 
    controlled and manipulated. 
    

<li>
Scalability of the rendering system can be realized 
    through dynamic tessellation. Depending on client CPU and 3D graphics system 
    performance, the level of detail (LOD) of the rendered NURBS model can be 
    adapted so that reasonable frame rates can be achieved on any system. 
    

<li>
Morphing, i.e. animation of single points of a 
    surface, is realized with minimal effort by an easy-to-understand method. 
    Animating single control points and altering weight values results in 
    naturally flowing movements. 
    

<li>
Using NURBS based splines for interpolation of positions along a curve
could reduce VRML file size for many types of animation.</li>
</ul>
The mathematical background required to work with NURBS is not very complex.
There are many <A href="#tools">tools</a>that can assist in the creation
and editing of NURBS surfaces. A good introduction to NURBS is given in
