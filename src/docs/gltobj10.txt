In this release all VRML Scene Tree texture handling
is done using the OpenGL 1.0 TextureObject extension if the
extension is found, or using the display list approach if the extension is not found.

This program will run on Windows NT 3.51 with OpenGL 1.0.

We could only test it on Windows NT without the extension.

Please let us know the results.

Currently if texture options like filtering and mip-map settings are changed 
in the GLView Dialog "Material->Texture Options" the effect will be visible
the next time a new scene is loaded.
Textures loaded by "Material->Load Texture" are still using the old displaylist method.
