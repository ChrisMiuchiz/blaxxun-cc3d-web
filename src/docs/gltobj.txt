In this release all VRML Scene Tree texture handling
is done using OpenGL 1.1 TextureObjects.
This program will only run on Windows NT 4.0 with OpenGL 1.1,

The program will not run on Windows NT 3.51 because of the missing texture
object calls in the OpenGL 1.0 DLL. This support can be added later.

Please let us know how the improvement is.

Currently if texture options like filtering and mip-map settings are changed 
in the GLView Dialog "Material->Texture Options" the effect will be visible
the next time a new scene is loaded.
Textures loaded by "Material->Load Texture" are still using the old displaylist
approach.
