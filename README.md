# Blaxxun Contact 3D 4.3

This repository contains source code for the Blaxxun Contact 3D VRML viewer. It
is provided here purely for historical and reference purposes and I have not
attempted to build any of the code.

The contents of this repository were extracted from the original cc3d_src.zip,
cc3d_lib.zip, and cc3d_doc.zip distributions released by Blaxxun Interactive
and the Web3D Consortium on August 11, 1999.

**Absolutely NO support is provided.**

    ==================================
    HOWTO Win32:
    
    You need DX SDK 7.0 & DXMedia SDK !
    Start up the provided dsp files in VC 5.0 or 6.0
    and compile. 
    
    Do not use the Katmai build variants, because this requires the Intel C Compiler.
