<H2>base64 encoding, in short</H2>

QP (base64-encoded) contains uppercase, lowercase, numbers, '+', '/' and '='.
<p>
Take the encoded stuff in groups of 4 characters and turn each character 
into a code 0 to 63 thus:
<ul>
<li>
A means of labelling the content of mail messages.
<li>A-Z map to 0 to 25
<li>a-z map to 26 to 51
<li>0-9 map to 52 to 61
<li>+ maps to 62
<li>/ maps to 63
</ul>
<p>
Express the four numbers thus found (all 0 to 63) in binary:
<p>
00aaaaaa 00bbbbbb 00cccccc 00dddddd
<p>
This then maps to _three_ real bytes formed thus:
<p>
aaaaaabb bbbbcccc ccdddddd
<p>
Equals signs (one or two) are used at the end of the encoded block to 
indicate that the text was not an integer multiple of three bytes long.
