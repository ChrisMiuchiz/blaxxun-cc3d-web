<H2><A name=Overview></A>Overview</H2>VRML2.0 (ISO/IEC 14772-1:1997) requires 
that browsers either support or ignore URNs in "url" MFString fields. Conforming 
browsers are required to ignore URNs if they don't understand what to do with 
them, and to skip on to the first URL in the field in this case. 
<P>URNs are ideal for naming elements of a library independent of their actual 
location. In fact, this is exactly what URNs were originally designed for, 
making them ideal for use with the Universal Media Element Library. 
<P>URN resolution (how a browser "resolves", or translates, a URN into a file) 
is the key issue addressed in this UMEL recommended practice proposal. While the 
Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has spent many years attempting to define 
how URNs should be resolved, an issue which remains outstanding, the lack of a 
standard solution for URN resolution does not <FONT 
color=#000000>preclude</FONT> the use of URNs for our purposes. Since "url" 
fields in VRML are multi-value, unlike those in HTML (which are single-value), 
and will only resolve to a previously installed library, our use of URNs is not 
contingent on the network-wide resolution method currently being sought by the 
IETF. 
<P>This document specifies a resolution mechanism to be used when a browser 
encounters a URN in a multi-value <I>url</I> field. 
<UL>
  <LI>Conforming browsers will follow this method to determine if&nbsp; a local 
  copy of the file exists, or will find out where&nbsp; to get it. If the file 
  isn't accessible, the browser will skip ahead to the next entry in the 
  <I>url</I> field. 
  <LI>Non-conforming browsers will follow the VRML2.0 requirements and skip over 
  the URN directly to the first URL. </LI></UL>

<TABLE border=0>
  <TBODY>
  <TR>

    <TD>Is the defined prefix for all URNs.</TD></TR>
  <TR>

    <TD>Specifies that this is the VRML Consortium's namespace (i.e. a place

  allocation).</TD></TR>

    <TD vAlign=top><PRE><B>umel:</B></PRE></TD>
    <TD>Is a string assigned by the VRML Consortium that specifies who is 
      assigning names. In this case, it specifies that the names are being 
      assigned by the Universal Medial Element Library working group. The the 
      VRML Consortium could, for example, also allocate "lw" to Living Worlds 
      defined names (for example Prototypes) or "pharmaceutical" to a working 
      group assigning names to Pharmaceutically related media elements.</TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD><PRE><B>texture/wood/oak.gif&nbsp;&nbsp;</B></PRE></TD>
    <TD>Is an example string assigned by the UMEL working group that is used

      case&nbsp; (note: the exact format of this string is still to be 
      determined by that group).</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
<P>The naming authority&nbsp; may also be any domain name registered to the 
supplier of a&nbsp; library, meaning,&nbsp; for example, that a URN could be of 
the form urn:vrml:sgi.com:toollibrary/0001.jpg&nbsp; where sgi.com has allocated 
the name "toollibrary/0001.jpg" 
<H2><BR><A name="URN Resolution"></A>URN Resolution</H2>When a browser tries to 
resolve a URN, it will attempt to determine where a library is installed,&nbsp; 
looking for the file there. In order to do this, the browser must first find 
configuration information (stored in a platform dependent location, as described 
in the Platform Specific Bindings section below) for an initial sub-string 
match. For example, with the URN above the browser is typically looking for a 
place that all or parts of the library "urn:vrml:umel:" is installed. 
<P>When the browser determines the location of the library, it will replace the 
initial sub-string of the URN with the location of the library, and find the 
file relative to that location. For instance, if the browser determines that the 
library "urn:vrml:umel:" is installed at "C:\vrml-libraries\umel\" then it will 
look for the file above at "C:\vrml-libraries\umel\texture\wood\oak.gif". If it 
finds the library is at "http://vrml.org/libs/umel",&nbsp; it will then retrieve 
the file from "http://vrml.org/libs/umel/texture/wood/oak.gif". 
<P><I>Note that on some platforms the character "/" in the URN will need to be 
replaced with the appropriate directory hierarchy separator character, for 
example "\" in DOS.</I> 
<P>If the file is not found at the location specified,&nbsp; the browser will 
then move to the next string in the <I>url</I> field. The next string in the 
<I>url</I> field&nbsp; will typically be the location (URL) of the file, 
although it might also be another URN. <BR>&nbsp; 
<H2><A name="Platform Specific Bindings"></A>Platform Specific Bindings</H2>The 
following section defines binding information for the most common personal 
computing platforms. 
<H3>Windows 95 and Windows NT</H3>Windows 95 / NT configuration information is 
kept in the registry. Registry entries live under the following key: <PRE>&nbsp; <B>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\VRML\PROTOCOLS\urn</B></PRE>where the key's 
name is derived from the URN, and the value gives the URL of the installed 
location of a specific library. This is a semi-colon separated list of 
alternative locations. 
<P>Continuing the example above, the key 
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\VRML\PROTOCOLS\urn\vrml\umel would have a value 
"file:///C|/vrml-libraries/umel". 
<P>If the library might optionally be found on a CD, then it might also have a 
value of "file:C|/vrml-libraries/umel;D:" 
<H3>Unix</H3>In Unix there must exist a file (named "urn_bindings") located at 
/etc/urn_bindings which contains one line per entry, such as: <PRE>&nbsp;<B>urn:vrml:umel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; file:///usr/local/lib/vrml-libraries/umel</B></PRE>or 
for multiple entries, with one option available locally via HTTP: <PRE>&nbsp;<B>urn:vrml:umel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; file:///usr/local/lib/vrml-libraries/umel;http://myserver/vrml-libraries/umel</B></PRE>where 
the part on the right is the initial sub-string being matched, and it is 
separated by white-space before the semi-colon (and optionally white-space) 
separated locations of the libraries. 
<P>Continuation lines may be separated by white-space, so the above could be 
written: <BR>&nbsp; <PRE><B>&nbsp;urn:vrml:umel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; file:///usr/local/lib/vrml-libraries/umel;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; http://myserver/vrml-libraries/umel</B></PRE>
<H3>Macintosh</H3>A file named "urn_bindings", identical to that for the Unix 
bindings above, is placed in the System/Preferences folder. 
<P><I>Note:&nbsp; The Preferences folder itself may need to be creating under 
System 6.x and earlier if it doesn't already exist since these versions of the 
Macintosh OS don't inherently support the notion of "Preferences" as System 7.x 
and greater does.</I> 
<H2><A name=Versioning></A><B>Versioning</B></H2>This proposed media element 
referencing system inherently handles versioning, and so no additional mechanism 
is necessary to accommodate different versions of libraries and/or individual 
library elements. While a detailed discussion of library content versioning 
isn't appropriate for this proposal (this proposal deals specifically with the 
issue of referencing library elements using URNs, not content issues such as 
versioning), a brief explanation of how UMEL handles versioning for entire 
libraries (the "Textures" library, for example) as well as the individual 
elements in those libraries (such as a texture element named "redbrick.gif") 
follows: 
<P><FONT size=-1>UMEL versioning is an additive process. New and/or updated 
content is assigned a unique name and added alongside existing content. Existing 
UMEL content is never replaced with new or updated material; it is only added to 
over time. This approach applies to entire libraries as well as individual 
elements.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=-1>Specifically, UMEL versioning is handled on an 
element-by-element basis by the introduction of new files (images, audio clips 
and 3D objects) into the core set of libraries ("Textures", "Sounds" and 
"Objects"). Similarly UMEL accommodates versioning on a library-by-library basis 
by the introduction of entirely new libraries to the core system ("Textures2.0", 
"Sounds2.0" and "Objects2.0", for example, which will reside alongside the core 
libraries).</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=-1>When a update to an existing library element is added to UMEL, 
it is given a unique file name to distinguish it from earlier versions of the 
element ("redbrick2.gif", for instance, would represent a new version of the 
"redbrick.gif" texture). Likewise, when a new version of the entire UMEL 
"Textures" library is introduced, it will be giving a unique name such as 
"Textures2.0" to distinguish it from the original "Textures" library.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=-1>This simple, elegant approach to versioning allows authors to 
specify precisely the media element they desire by name, without concern for 
changes or updates to UMEL. Since each new version of a library or element is 
assigned a unique name, authors can be certain that the elements they reference 
will never be replaced with an updated version. If they wish to take advantage 
of an updated library or element version, they do so by updating their VRML 
world's URN references accordingly.</FONT> 
<P><I>Note: A directory named "version" (urn:vrml:umel:version) is reserved for 
future use should the need to track version numbers arise (inside this directory 
files related to library version numbers can be stored if needed).</I>

<H2><BR><A name=Summary></A>Summary</H2>URNs are an ideal mechanism for 
referencing VRML Universal Media Element Library (VRML-UMEL) elements such as 
textures, sounds and objects. Using URNs in VRML-UMEL does not require the IETF 
to define a standard resolution method. By following the recommended practice 
set forth in this document, VRML tool vendors, browser developers and content 
authors may use URNs to reference UMEL elements today.
